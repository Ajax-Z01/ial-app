                <li class="mb-4">
                  <p>The Fundamentals of Linear Accelerator (Linac) Technology: A linear accelerator operates on the principle of accelerating charged particles, such as electrons or protons, in a straight path using electromagnetic fields. It consists of a series of accelerating structures or cavities that create alternating electric fields, propelling the particles forward. As the particles traverse these cavities, they gain energy, achieving high velocities close to the speed of light.</p>

                <li class="mb-4">
                  <p>Advancements in Particle Physics Research: Linear accelerators have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the universe. In particle physics research, Linacs are used to propel charged particles to high energies, enabling scientists to study particle interactions, investigate the properties of matter, and explore the fundamental forces that govern the universe. Linac technology has been instrumental in experiments conducted at renowned research facilities like CERN, contributing to groundbreaking discoveries, including the Higgs boson.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                  <p>Application in Cancer Treatment: Linear accelerators have transformed cancer treatment through a technique called external beam radiation therapy. In this application, Linacs are used to deliver precisely targeted beams of high-energy particles, such as X-rays or electrons, to destroy cancerous tumors while sparing healthy surrounding tissues. The ability to shape and modulate the radiation beams allows clinicians to customize treatments, maximizing therapeutic effectiveness and minimizing side effects.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                  <p>Enhanced Treatment Capabilities: Advancements in Linac technology have revolutionized cancer treatment approaches. Modern Linacs incorporate advanced imaging systems, such as CT scanners, to precisely locate tumors and ensure accurate treatment delivery. Additionally, technologies like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) further enhance treatment precision, enabling tailored radiation doses and real-time tumor tracking during treatment sessions.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                  <p>Research and Technological Advancements: Ongoing research aims to improve the efficiency, precision, and accessibility of Linac technology. Innovations such as compact Linacs and mobile units make radiation therapy accessible in remote and underserved areas, expanding cancer treatment options worldwide. Furthermore, efforts to develop advanced imaging techniques, particle beam guidance systems, and treatment planning algorithms continue to refine the capabilities of Linacs, ensuring optimal patient outcomes.</p>
